# 2024_Bano_Emulators_AIES
## Repository containing the code reproducing the results in Ba√±o-Medina et al., 2024. 
This repository consists of a collection of Python scripts encapsulating the base functions needed to reproduce the results. Additionally, it includes a Jupyter Notebook illustrating how to apply those functions.

Both GCM and RCM data used in this study ---from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) and CORDEX, respectively,--- are openly available from the Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF, \url{https://esgf.llnl.gov}) portal. The code needed to implement the DeepESD model can be found in a Zenodo repository (\url{https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6828303}, \cite{bano_medina_2022_zenodo}) associated to a previous publication \citep{bano_downscaling_2022}.
